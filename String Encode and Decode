        Understand: 
        I am thinking of joining each element in string with "-" and then
        and then string will split into list using -
        but there will be issue for empty array then but there will be some issues so in that case 
        you will get total number of elements in the group and add it to "-" and then add to string.

        While decoding you will iterate thru each of them and add then until u see "-" and append to list 
            algorithm is that we first find out total number of charcaters in string
            then we will move i to begining of the word and j to the end of the word. and append
            string from i to j.
            and in the end update i and j.       
        '''
        res = ""

        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s))+"-"+s
        return res

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        i = 0
        res = []
        while i<len(s):
            j = i
            while(s[j]!="-"):
                j = j+1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            i = j+1   # i is at j plus 1
            j = i + length #moving to the end of the string    
            res.append(s[i:j])
            i = j
        return res
